Artemis Financial is a company that helps clients create personal financial plans, like saving for retirement or managing investments. They wanted to modernize their web application and make sure client data was protected. My job was to find security issues in their code and strengthen it by adding encryption, HTTPS, and a checksum feature to verify data integrity.

I think I did a good job identifying potential vulnerabilities and making the application more secure without breaking its functionality. Making sure the code is secure is so important because it protects sensitive information and builds trust with clients, especially for a financial company that handles private data every day. Strong security also keeps a company’s systems reliable and helps prevent breaches or downtime.

The hardest but most helpful part of the project was figuring out how to handle false positives in the dependency-check report. It taught me how to tell the difference between real threats and harmless alerts. To increase the app’s security, I used AES-256 encryption, added HTTPS for secure communication, and used the OWASP Dependency-Check tool to make sure I didn’t introduce new risks. After refactoring, I tested everything to make sure everything still worked as expected this also included dependency checks. I also made sure the checksum and SSL features worked properly. One resource that really helped were the OWASP documentation, it not only helped me with identifying potential weaknesses but also effectively filtering out false positives.

If I were showing my work to a future employer, I’d share this project. It shows that I can find and fix security flaws, write secure code, and use professional tools to protect data; skills that are valuable in any software development or cybersecurity role.
